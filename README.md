# ImprovedAdminPhysgun
 
quick gmod addon i wrote in 4 hours

## Features
- Prevent fall damage on players dropped by the physgun
- Prevent damage on players currently being held by the physgun
- Prevent players from attacking when held by the physgun
- Allow freezing players using the physgun
- Stop players from falling down when repeatedly grabbing them with the physgun

### Note
This addon doesn't implement grabbing players with the physgun, and only complements addons that do. You'll still need an admin mod to allow that in the first place.
