# ImprovedAdminPhysgun
An addon aiming to improve how the physgun works on players by adding new functionality and fixing some of its' bugs.

## Features
- Prevent fall damage on players dropped by the physgun
- Prevent damage on players currently being held by the physgun
- Prevent players from attacking when held by the physgun
- Allow freezing players using the physgun
- DarkRP integration _(just anti-arrest for now)_
- Stop players from falling down when repeatedly grabbing them with the physgun
- Configurable in-game

**_Note:_** This addon doesn't implement grabbing players with the physgun, and only complements addons that do. You'll still need an admin mod to allow that in the first place.
